// Here in JS, we will be using "let, var and const"

// "var" is the older way of using variables but with the latest version of JS we will be using "let and const" still we can use "var"

let num1 = 10
console.log(num1);

num1 = 20
console.log(num1);

const x1 = 100
console.log(x1);

// x1 = 200 This cannot be done as we cannot change the value of a constant
// console.log(x1); 

// It is completely optional to use a semi-colon at the end and even if we don't write it will work fine

// Rules for creating variables:
// 1. Don't use the reserved keywords for as a variable name
// 2. Don't start the variable name with a number
// 3. Variable names are case sensitive so, "John", "johN" and "john" will be 2 different variables
// 4. Avoid using hyphen in variable name
// 5. Can use underscore
